#Weather Pattern Prediction Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for predicting temperature trends in major cities of Thailand using historical weather data from the Open-Meteo API. The project utilizes Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to forecast future temperatures and visualizes the results with Streamlit.

Key Features

- Automatically fetches historical temperature data from the Open-Meteo API
- Supports city selection (Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket) and customizable date ranges
- Performs feature engineering and trains a Linear Regression model for prediction
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted temperatures and displays Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit

Possible Extensions

- Add new features such as rainfall or humidity prediction
- Experiment with other Machine Learning models
- Integrate automatic alerting for abnormal temperature predictions
- Support data from multiple sources or countries
